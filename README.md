# TripAdvisor Dataset EDA
As part of my analysis of the TripAdvisor dataset, I performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a better understanding of the data and to identify any trends or patterns that may be useful for further analysis.

To begin, I visualized the data using a variety of techniques, including histograms, scatter plots, and box plots. These plots helped me to understand the distribution of the data and to identify any potential outliers or anomalies.

I also looked at summary statistics for the data, including measures of central tendency (such as mean and median) and measures of dispersion (such as standard deviation and interquartile range). These statistics provided a quantitative overview of the data and helped me to understand the overall shape of the distribution.

In addition to these basic analyses, I also looked for correlations between different variables in the dataset. For example, I might have examined the relationship between the number of reviews a hotel has received and its overall rating, or the relationship between the price of a hotel and its location. These correlations can provide valuable insights into the factors that influence a hotel's rating or price.
